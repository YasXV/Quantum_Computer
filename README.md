# Quantum_Computer
A simpler version of the IBM quantum composer (with a user interface), using object oriented c++. 
The libraries that are mostly used are boost and SFML (for the user interface).

## How to run the code ? 
-Place yourself in the "fichiers_cpp" directory. 
-Open a terminal.
-Write " make ordi" on the terminal.
-Have fun building your own quantum circuits.
