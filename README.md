# Quantum_Computer
A simpler version of the IBM quantum composer (with a user interface), using object oriented c++. 
The libraries that are mostly used are boost and SFML (for the user interface).

## How to run the code ? 
Download all the directories. Keeping up the sae structure. 
Place yourself in the "fichiers_cpp" directory. 
Open a terminal.
Write " make ordi" on the terminal.


## How to use the user interface ?
Drag and drop the quantum gates on the circuit's line that corresponds to the quibit. Just like the IBM quantum composer. 
Right click on a quantum gate on circuit line to delete it. 
Push on the "plus" button to add a quibit. Push on the "minus" button to remove a quibit. 


Have fun building your own quantum circuits.
